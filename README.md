# Big Data Meetup Hamburg: Visualize Open Source Communities

This talk is about sharing some ideas on how I'd like to visualize Open Source communities with the awesome folks at the [Big Data & NoSQL Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BDNSHH/) Hamburg in Hamburg.

It gives some real-life examples based on my work with the [TYPO3 community](http://typo3.org/community).
